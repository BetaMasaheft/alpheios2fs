# alpheios2fs
This mini application joins the workflow of alignment in the Alpheios alignment tool with the morphological parsing and search functionality of the Beta Masaheft Research Environment.

Once live, on upload of a new set of annotations and alignments, it receives a payload from the repository, transforms it to TEI Feature Structures using the values established by the Traces project and stores it with the morphological parser and as RDF to be exploited by other resources.
